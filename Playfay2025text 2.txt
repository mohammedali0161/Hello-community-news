We joined in the nationwide celebration of #NationalPlayDay â€“ a special day that highlights every childâ€™s right to play and the incredible benefits it brings to their health, happiness, and creativity.

Khizra Mosque was buzzing with joy as children of all ages enjoyed a fantastic range of fun-filled activities â€“ from arts & crafts to free play, team sports, and more! âš½

The highlight? Cutting the cake together and celebrating a day dedicated just to children.  

It was a day full of laughter, friendship, and memorable moments â€“ all made possible through the power of play.

A huge thank you to all the families, staff, and volunteers who helped make the day so special ðŸ’›
And a big shoutout to @ManCityCouncil and @UNICEF for championing childrenâ€™s rights and the importance of play!
